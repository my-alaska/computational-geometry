# Convex Hull

This piece of code is a simple exercise for solving a convex hull problem with Graham's algorithm and Jarvis' algorithm

### The exercise consists of 4 tasks:

Generating 4 sets of points in 2 dimensional space - square, circle, square and square's diagonals with 2 of the square's sides

Implementation of Graham's and Jarvis' algorithms. Graham's algorithm should be implemented in 2 variations - one with python's built-in sorting and the other one with student's own implementation of sorting algorithm

Testing both algorithms on the sets of points generated in the first task and comparing their execution time
