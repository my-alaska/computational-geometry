# Intersections

This piece of code is a simple exercise for finding intersections of a given set of line segments on a 2 dimensional plane

### The exercise consisted of 2 tasks:

Implementation of sweeping algorithm for checking if in a given set of line segments at least two intersect

Implementation of sweeping algorithm for finding all intersections in a given set of line segments
