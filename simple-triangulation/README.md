# Simple Triangulation

This piece of code is a simple exercise for solving a triangulation problem for monotone polygons

### The exercise consisted of 3 tasks:

Implementation of algorithm for checking if given polygon is y-monotone

Implementation of algorithm for classifying regular, start, end, merge and split vertices of a given polygon

Implementation of algorithm for triangulating a monotone polygon with visualisation of algorithm's consecutive steps
